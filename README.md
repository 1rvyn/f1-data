# f1-data

This was a project I completed in uni for a web class, it was focused around the displaying of the telemetry data as I wanted to use the python library and have it be displayed on a website - the use of certain libraries and tech stacks is due to the marking scheme for the class I did this for as I needed to use certain things. 

I wouldn't to send the picture though a web-socket but for the sake of getting grades I used a websocket & had some fun looking at how images can be decoded/encoded.
