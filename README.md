# f1-data

This was a project I completed in college for a web class, it was focused around the displaying of the telemetry data as I wanted to use the python library and have it be displayed on a website - the use of certain libraries and tech stacks is due to the marking scheme for the class I did this for as I needed to use certain things. 

It's over engineered to send the picture though a web-socket but for the sake of getting grades I used a websocket and learnt how to decode images on the browser side in the mean-time.
